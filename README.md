# Flutter form sample

Flutter showcase of a form with a button

The aim of this project is to showcase how a form can load its initial content from an async call
and enable a "save" button only after this initial data has been modified.

## More details

This is a minimalistic example. Therefore only a StatefulWidget is in place. For real world examples
a proper architecture approach might be worth implementing (bloc, provider, etc...)
